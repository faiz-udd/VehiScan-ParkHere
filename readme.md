# [Perfect Parking]

Perfect Parking aims to create a parking system that will replace outdated systems and help stop the widespread problem that is parking in our cities. The goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness of finding parking spaces and to also relieve the stress of the users looking for parking by implementing new and innovative features. This will be done by building a client-server API and website that will show the user exactly where the parking is. The server will be supported by parking monitor clients powered by OpenCV to detect if a parking spot has been filled or made empty.
